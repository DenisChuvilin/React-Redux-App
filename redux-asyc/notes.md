    describe the Finite State Machine pattern and it's relationship to building Redux applications
        
        a state machine has
            - initial state (store)
            - current state (store)
            - inputs or actions that trigger transitions (reducers) to the state.

    implement Redux Middleware libraries into a Redux Store using `applyMiddleware`
        
    effectively use `redux-thunk` and asynchronous action creators to consume data from external API's
